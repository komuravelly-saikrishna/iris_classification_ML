# iris_classification_ML
My aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) from measurements of sepals and petals' length and width.
This project uses UCI repository as the dataset-http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris
This project is to classify flowers into several categories based on the features given in the dataset
I have used two ML algorithm in this project
  1-Decision Tree
  2-KNN Model
In both the algorithms accuracy was 100 percent in the test dataset.
